# Loan-Amount-Prediction
Predicting the loan amount that should be given for a specific customer using bank dataset.
"classified-data.csv" is the dataset that is used here

There is a Bank that gives loan to the people for their requirements. They have 
presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for 
loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. However doing 
this manually takes a lot of time. Hence it wants to automate the loan eligibility 
process (real time) based on customer information
So the final thing is to identify the factors/ customer segments that are eligible for 
taking loan. How will the company benefit if we give the customer segments is 
the immediate question that arises. The solution is â€¦.Banks would give loans to 
only those customers that are eligible so that they can be assured of getting the 
money back. Hence the more accurate we are in predicting the eligible customers 
the more beneficial it would be for the Bank
